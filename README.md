# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors game coded by me while working through The Odin Project!
This was my first time trying to build something with javascript. In it I learned:
- How to use arrays (while generating a random computer-opponent selection)
- How to create basic functions (generating the computer's selection, comparing it to the player selection, displaying round results)
- How to use if/else if/else statements (comparing computer and player selections to choose winner, displaying correct results post round, displaying the final results)
- How to nest functions within eachother (game function > round function > results functions)
- How to work in a for loop to increment a round system (5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors - increment 0-5)
- How to prompt the end user for input (player selection)
- How to do basic debugging to determine where errors are (multiple issues arose with incrementing currently, displaying incorrect results, etc.)
- How to do some basic console error interpretation
- How to use the console to check variable values etc.

The game is played in the console, so if you decide to play open it there and have fun!
